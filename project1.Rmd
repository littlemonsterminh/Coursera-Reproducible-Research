This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

NOW STARTING THE PROJECT REPORT:

## MAKING THE CODE VISIBLE
```{r, echo = TRUE}
echo = TRUE  # Always make code visible
options(scipen = 1)  # Turn off scientific notations for numbers
```

## LOADING AND PROCESSING THE DATA:
```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses = c("integer", "Date", "factor"))
data$month <- as.numeric(format(data$date, "%m"))
noNA <- na.omit(data)
rownames(noNA) <- 1:nrow(noNA)
head(noNA)
dim(noNA)
library(ggplot2)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
# PLOT THE HISTOGRAM:
```{r}
ggplot(noNA, aes(date, steps)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity", 
	colour = "steelblue", fill = "steelblue", width = 0.7) 
	+ facet_grid(. ~ month, scales = "free") 
	+ labs(title = "Histogram of Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day", x = "Date", y = "Total number of steps")
```
# MEAN:
```{r}
totalSteps <- aggregate(noNA$steps, list(Date = noNA$date), FUN = "sum")$x
mean(totalSteps)
```
# MEDIAN:
```{r}
median(totalSteps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
# MAKE A TIME SERIES PLOT (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{R}
avgSteps <- aggregate(noNA$steps, list(interval = as.numeric(as.character(noNA$interval))), FUN = "mean")
names(avgSteps)[2] <- "meanOfSteps"

ggplot(avgSteps, aes(interval, meanOfSteps)) 
	+ geom_line(color = "steelblue", size = 0.8) 
	+ labs(title = "Time Series Plot of the 5-minute Interval", x = "5-minute intervals", y = "Average Number of Steps Taken")
```
# MAXIMUM NUMBEROF STEPS: Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{R}
avgSteps[avgSteps$meanOfSteps == max(avgSteps$meanOfSteps), ]
```

## Imputing missing values
# I HAVE NO IDEA !

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
# I HAVE NO IDEA !
